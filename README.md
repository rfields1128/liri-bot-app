# liri-bot-app
The Liri bot app is a perfect solution for anyone who likes to keep up to date with movies and music nearby! L.I.R.I. is a Language
Interpretation and Recognition Interface, but LIRI is much easier. LIRI takes in input from a user and then gives back data based on what you typed. You can 
search through OMDB for movies, Spotify for song title info, and Bandsintown for concerts nearby.

the package.json helps the user pickup from where I left off in case anyone intends on improving it any further. The keys.js and .env 
files serve as a way for users to provide their own spotify client ID/Secret.

This app was built with the following:
  Node.js
  Node File System
  Axios
  DotEnv
  JavaScript
  Moment.js
  OMDB API
  Bandsintown API
  Node Spotify API
